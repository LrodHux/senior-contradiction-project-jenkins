# senior-contradiction-project-jenkins
A repository for the code used in my senior project.
This repository consists of two documents and a folder.
The first of these two documents is my written proposal. This is the document created to outline the project's goal, reason, and time frame for completion.
The second of these two documents is my final report. This consists of the coding methodology used, what the program does in its finalized state, and the results garnered from the project as a whole.
The folder contains all of the code relavent to the project. Inside, there is a readme file which explains how the code should be run, and how to conduct your own tests using the code contained in the folder.
